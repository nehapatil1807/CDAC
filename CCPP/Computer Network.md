**Network Definition:**

A **network** is a collection of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, routers, and switches) that communicate with each other to share data and resources.

**Example:**
A local area network (**LAN**) in an office where multiple computers are connected to a central server to share files and printers.

**Network Topology:**

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices in a network. It defines how devices are connected and communicate with each other.

**Types of Network Topologies:**

1. **Bus Topology:** All devices share a single communication line or backbone. If the main cable fails, the entire network goes down.
2. **Star Topology:** All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. If the hub fails, the entire network is affected.
3. **Ring Topology:** Devices are connected in a circular manner, with data traveling in one or both directions. A single break can disrupt communication.
4. **Mesh Topology:** Every device is connected to every other device, providing high redundancy but increasing cost and complexity.
5. **Tree Topology:** A combination of bus and star topologies, where multiple star networks are connected to a backbone cable.
6. **Hybrid Topology:** A mix of two or more topologies, offering flexibility and scalability.

**Key Network Terms:**

- **Bandwidth:** The maximum data transfer rate of a network or internet connection, measured in bits per second (bps).
- **Node:** Any device connected to a network, such as a computer, printer, or router.
- **Link:** The physical or logical connection between two nodes that allows data to be transmitted.

**TCP/IP Model:**

The **TCP/IP Model** is a set of communication protocols used for transmitting data over networks, including the internet. It consists of four layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS, enabling user applications to communicate over the network.
2. **Transport Layer:** Provides reliable or unreliable data transport using protocols like TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless).
3. **Internet Layer:** Handles addressing, routing, and packet forwarding using protocols like IP, ICMP, and ARP.
4. **Network Access Layer:** Manages the physical transmission of data through hardware interfaces such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

**OSI Model:**

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication across seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and transmission signals.
2. **Data Link Layer:** Ensures reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes and manages MAC addresses and error detection.
3. **Network Layer:** Handles packet forwarding, addressing, and routing using IP addresses.
4. **Transport Layer:** Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control using protocols like TCP and UDP.
5. **Session Layer:** Manages sessions between applications, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Converts data formats, encrypts/decrypts information, and handles data compression.
7. **Application Layer:** Provides user-facing network services such as web browsing, email, and file transfer using protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and FTP.
