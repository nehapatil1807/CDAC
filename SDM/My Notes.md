# Requirements Engineering

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It ensures that the software meets the needs of stakeholders while addressing feasibility and technical constraints.

---

## 1. Types of Requirements
Requirements are categorized into three main types:

### (a) **Functional Requirements**
- Define what the system should do.
- Focus on specific functionalities or features.
  
  **Real-Time Example**:
  - In an online food delivery app: 
    - Users should be able to search for restaurants.
    - Place orders.
    - Track deliveries in real-time.

### (b) **Non-Functional Requirements**
- Define the quality attributes or constraints of the system, such as performance, scalability, and security.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - The food delivery app must:
    - Load within 3 seconds.
    - Handle up to 100,000 users simultaneously.
    - Ensure secure payment transactions using encryption.

### (c) **Domain Requirements**
- Specific to the business or domain in which the software operates.
  
  **Real-Time Example**:
  - For a banking system:
    - Support multi-currency transactions.
    - Adhere to regulatory compliance like GDPR or PCI DSS.

---

## 2. Steps Involved in Requirements Engineering
The process involves several systematic steps:

### Step 1: **Elicitation**
- Gathering requirements from stakeholders (users, clients, business owners).

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - For an e-commerce website:
    - Conduct interviews with customers to understand their shopping preferences.
    - Hold brainstorming sessions with stakeholders for feature ideas.

### Step 2: **Analysis**
- Refining and prioritizing the gathered requirements to ensure they are feasible and necessary.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - Identify that:
    - "Product recommendations" are a high-priority feature.
    - "Multiple language support" can be deferred to a later phase.

### Step 3: **Specification**
- Documenting requirements in a clear and concise manner, often using tools like use case diagrams or user stories.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - Write user stories like:
    - "As a customer, I want to add items to my shopping cart so that I can purchase multiple items at once."

### Step 4: **Validation**
- Ensuring that the requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - Conduct review meetings with stakeholders to confirm that features like "cash on delivery" meet their expectations.

### Step 5: **Management**
- Continuously tracking, updating, and managing changes to requirements.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - If stakeholders request "live chat support," update the documentation and reallocate resources to implement this feature.

---

## 3. Requirement Analysis Modelling
Requirement analysis modeling helps to represent requirements visually to enhance understanding and communication. Common techniques include:

### (a) **Use Case Diagrams**
- Represent interactions between users (actors) and the system.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - In a library management system, a use case diagram shows:
    - Users borrowing books.
    - Admin adding or removing books.

### (b) **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**
- Show how data flows within the system.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - For a banking system:
    - A DFD illustrates how customer information flows from login to transaction processing and account updates.

### (c) **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**
- Define relationships between data entities.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - For an e-commerce app:
    - An ERD shows relationships between customers, orders, and products.

### (d) **Prototypes**
- Create a visual representation of the system’s UI to gather feedback early.

  **Real-Time Example**:
  - Create a prototype of a mobile banking app to show stakeholders how the "transfer money" feature will look and work.
