Using Subqueries with DML Commands.

1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one customer into this table.

mysql> INSERT INTO Multicust
    -> SELECT * FROM salespeople
    -> WHERE snum IN(SELECT snum FROM Customers
    -> GROUP BY snum
    -> HAVING COUNT(cnum) > 1);


2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

mysql> delete from customers
    -> where cnum not in ( select distinct cnum from orders);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> select * from customers;
+------+----------+----------+--------+------+
| Cnum | Cname    | City     | Rating | Snum |
+------+----------+----------+--------+------+
| 2001 | Hoffman  | London   |    100 | 1001 |
| 2002 | Giovanni | Rome     |    300 | 1003 |
| 2003 | Liu      | San Jose |    200 | 1004 |
| 2004 | Grass    | Berlin   |    300 | 1004 |
| 2008 | Cisneros | San Jose |    300 | 1007 |
| 2007 | Pereira  | Rome     |    200 | 1004 |
+------+----------+----------+--------+------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)



3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

mysql> update salespeople
    -> set comm = comm * 1.2
    -> where snum in (select snum from orders
    -> group by snum
    -> having sum(amt) > 3000);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql> select * from salespeople;
+------+---------+-----------+------+
| Snum | Sname   | City      | Comm |
+------+---------+-----------+------+
| 1001 | Peel    | London    | 0.12 |
| 1002 | Serres  | San Jose  | 0.16 |
| 1004 | Motika  | London    | 0.11 |
| 1007 | Rikin   | Barcelona | 0.15 |
| 1003 | Axelrod | New York  | 0.10 |
